Welcome!

This is an application, that sends data via Bluetooth,
to an external tool. Do not forget to install PyBluez,
before running the script.

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyBluez

Any other modules are not necessary to be installed.
The Tkinter in-built graphical module was imported,
to build a graphical-user-interface for the app.

If you click the canvas, and hold down left mouse button,
the app sends the coordinates, according to the cursor.
Y coordinate describes throttle,
X coordinate describes steering.
These two values were needed to produce an 8-bit PWM signal,
for the two ESC for our BLDC motors.

Thanks for reading!
